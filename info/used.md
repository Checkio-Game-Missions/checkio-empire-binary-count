**How it is used:**

Binary as a computer language is very difficult for humans to understand, 
but makes the lives of our computers and robots easier. 
Every time you press a key on your keyboard it sends a binary signal informing the computer you hit that key. 
Every time you code a program, the computer takes your code and interprets it in binary then executes your program.
